Command line draughts game written in Java. This project was made by three INSA Lyon students for first year computer science class.

## Commands

Move the pawns by typing `[source] [dest]`, for example : `b3 c4`. Pressing enter without specifying any move will do a random move.

You can find help on commands by typing `?`. Note that the game is in French.

## Running the game

Requirement : Java 11 or above

Download the file named `Draughts.jar` in the Releases section, and execute it by typing in the command line :

```bash
java -jar Draughts.jar
```

Alternatively, the game can be run online on the [Replit page](https://replit.com/@Lysquid/Dames), or by opening the project in VS Code with the Extension Pack for Java installed.
